Students should grasp that elasticity is a unit-free measure that allows comparison across markets and is essential for revenue management, taxation analysis, and policy design. The revenue test (elastic demand → price and revenue move opposite; inelastic → same direction) is particularly important for business applications. Emphasize that tourism generally has high price elasticity (especially leisure travel), making the industry vulnerable to economic shocks but also responsive to pricing strategies."
